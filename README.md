# To Do app
This is a kotlin mobile app that is used to test Recylcer view with multiple viewholders. Additionally, it allows the user to input data (Title, Description, Deadline) to add it to the recyler view list.
The inputted data are then stored into Room Database to save for local storage and data persistence when navigating through fragments.
